# Team Kickoff Meeting - December 22, 2025

**Attendees:** Sarah (PM), Alex (Backend), Jordan (Frontend)

## Agenda

1. Tech stack decisions
2. Timeline review
3. Next steps

## Discussion

### Database Selection

**Alex:** I've been evaluating options for our database needs. Given our requirements for real-time subscriptions and built-in auth, I think we should consider Supabase.

**Sarah:** What are the alternatives?

**Alex:** We could go with a traditional PostgreSQL setup with separate services, but Supabase gives us auth, storage, and real-time out of the box.

**Jordan:** That would speed up our frontend development significantly.

**Decision:** We decided to use Supabase as the primary database for the project.

### Frontend Framework

**Jordan:** For the frontend, I recommend Next.js with the App Router. It gives us SSR, API routes, and great developer experience.

**Sarah:** Any concerns with that approach?

**Alex:** None from the backend side. It integrates well with Supabase.

**Decision:** We'll use Next.js with App Router for the frontend.
