# Sprint Planning Meeting - December 22, 2025

**Attendees:** Sarah (PM), Alex (Backend), Jordan (Frontend)

## Authentication Discussion

### Requirements

**Sarah:** Authentication is critical for our MVP. What's our plan?

**Alex:** I've researched several options. Clerk looks promising - it handles social logins, MFA, and user management out of the box.

**Jordan:** I've used Clerk before. The React components are really polished and the documentation is excellent.

### Decision

**Sarah:** So we're going with Clerk?

**Alex:** Yes, we'll implement Clerk auth for the authentication layer. It should integrate well with our Next.js setup.

**Jordan:** I can start on the login/signup pages once the Clerk project is set up.

**Plan:** We will implement Clerk for authentication. Alex will set up the Clerk project and Jordan will build the auth UI components.

## Timeline

- Week 1: Set up Clerk, build auth pages
