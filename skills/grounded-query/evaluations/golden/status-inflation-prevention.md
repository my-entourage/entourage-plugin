Based on the meeting transcripts, authentication was **discussed** but I cannot confirm if it is complete.

## Evidence

| Claim | Status | Source |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Authentication discussed | SUPPORTED | 2025-12-22-kickoff.md |
| Authentication implemented | NOT FOUND | No code evidence |

**What was found:** The team discussed plans to implement Clerk authentication. The transcript shows: "we'll implement Clerk auth for user management."

**Important:** Discussion of a feature does not indicate it is complete. To verify implementation status, use `/local-repo-check` or `/github-repo-check` to scan for actual code evidence.
